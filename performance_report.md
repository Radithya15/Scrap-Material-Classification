## 4. Key Takeaways & Analysis

- **High-Performing Classes:** The model shows high precision and recall for classes like [**Enter best performing class, e.g., 'glass'**] and [**e.g., 'metal'**], indicating it can identify them reliably.
- **Areas for Improvement:** The model occasionally confuses [**Enter a confused pair, e.g., 'paper' and 'cardboard'**], as seen in the confusion matrix. This is expected due to their visual similarity. Similarly, the 'trash' category may have lower scores as it can contain a wide variety of objects.
- **Overall Effectiveness:** The model is a strong baseline for an automated scrap sorting system. The high overall accuracy suggests it would be a valuable tool.

## 5. Next Steps

- **Data Augmentation:** Increase the number of images for underperforming classes or apply more aggressive data augmentation to improve generalization.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, or optimizers to further boost performance.
- **Model Architecture:** For higher accuracy, consider using a more complex pretrained model like ResNet50 or EfficientNet.
